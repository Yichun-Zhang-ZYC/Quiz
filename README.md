# üç∑ Wine Dataset Exploration

**Live on github-link:https://github.com/Yichun-Zhang-ZYC/Quiz**

This notebook performs a basic analysis of the classic Wine dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.  
The dataset contains chemical analysis results of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars.

We will:
- Load the dataset using `pandas`
- Clean and inspect the data
- Visualize wine class distribution using `matplotlib`

---

## Load and Inspect the Dataset
We begin by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset from the UCI repository.  
The dataset does not include headers, so we manually assign them for clarity.

---


## Visualize Wine Class Distribution
We create a bar chart showing how many samples belong to each wine class (1, 2, and 3).

Each class corresponds to a different grape cultivar.  
This gives us an overview of how balanced the dataset is across wine types.
